# Weather-Dashboard
## Description
- The motivation behind this project is to create a weather dashboard for a user to find accurate weather data by using what I have learned thus far with html, css, javascript and bootstrap.
- This dashboard is purposeful in generating accurate data for a user to determine weather and how to dress for or make plans regarding the data.
- My html, css, javascript and bootstrap skills have been enhanced and I have better learned how to use open weather map.

## Installation
I started by creating a repository on Github with a unique but descriptive name and cloned the SSH key to my Terminal to work locally.
I then began working on the html and css to create my basic page layout before moving onto the javascript.
I used the OpenWeatherMap website to gain access to the keys necessary to link to the api to retrieve the most accurate data.
## Usage
Simply search any city in the entire world to find accurate current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV. Screen shot is included in images folder in assets.
